The University of Queensland The University of Queensland (UQ) is one of Australia’s leading teaching and research universities. For more than a century, UQ has educated and worked with outstanding people to deliver knowledge leadership for a better world.UQ ranks among the world’s top universities, and with a strong focus on teaching excellence, has won more national teaching awards than any other Australian university.UQ’s 307,000 graduates are an engaged network of global alumni spanning more than 170 countries, and include more than 15,800 PhDs. More than 56,000 current students – including the majority of Queensland’s highest academic achievers, more than 20,000 postgraduates, and approximately 21,000 international students from 142 countries – currently study across UQ’s three campuses in South East Queensland.UQ’s six faculties, eight globally recognised research institutes and more than 100 research centres attract an interdisciplinary community of 1500 scientists, social scientists and engineers who champion research excellence and continue UQ’s tradition of research leadership.
