Universit Paris-Saclay Paris-Saclay University , created on January 1st, 2020, brings together in anew university the academic components of former Université Paris-Sud, four"grandes écoles" (CentraleSupélec, AgroParisTech, ENS Paris-Saclayand IOGS), and a research institute (IHES). Two universities, the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and the University of Evry-Val d'Essonne, are associated with the project as part of a plan to merge with theParis-Saclay University by 2025, and six national research organizations (CNRS,CEA, INRAE, INRIA, INSERM, ONERA) join in within a strengthened partnership.Centrale Supélec (CS) is a French institute of research and higher education in engineering and science. It was established on 1 January 2015 as a result of a strategic merger between two leading grandes écoles in France, Ecole Centrale Paris and Supélec to formone of the most prestigious and selective grandes écoles. It is a key founding member of the University of Paris-Saclay, the T.I.M.E. (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network and also the CESAER association of European engineering schools. The institution delivers the CS engineering degree, masters and PhDs.Agro Paris Tech is a higher education and research institute (“Grande Ecole”) aiming at addressing some of the main global challenges of the 21st century : feeding a growing population while sustainably managing territories, preserving natural resources, supporting innovation and integrating the bio-economy.The Ecole normale supérieure Paris-Saclay , a prestigious public institution of higher education and research founded in 1912, is one of the major French Grandes Écoles, which are considered the pinnacle of French higher education. With its multi disciplinary departments and their associated research laboratories, the ENS Paris-Saclay provides its students with a high-level cultural and scientific training. The four years of study at the ENS Paris-Saclay are organised in agreement with classic European university curricula (BA/BSc and Master's degrees) along with complementary training and some specific courses.The Institut d’Optique aims to bring together in one single institution all activities related to photonics: research, higher education and training, innovation, business creation, consulting and technology transfer. It is the first Western training institution at this level in physical sciences for optics and photonics. Graduates become engineers, researchers or managers in many fields. The technologies they develop are at the heart of major technological revolutions and impact many areas of our society: aeronautics and space, energy and sustainable development, optical and digital technologies of information (signals, data and images), defense and security, transport, telecommunications, biosciences and health...Located south of Paris, on a vast territory (from Paris to Orsay, via Evry and Versailles),Paris-Saclay University benefits from a strategic geographical and socio-economic position enhanced by its international visibility. Cutting-edge, with a predominantly scientific focus but also recognised for its training inhuman and social sciences, Université Paris-Saclay operates on a classified and protected natural site, close to Paris, and at the heart of a dynamic ecosystem.
