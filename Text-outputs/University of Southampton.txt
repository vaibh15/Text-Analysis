University of Southampton We are a research-intensive university and a founding member of the Russell Group. Founded in 1862 as the Hartley Institution, the University of Southampton was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 in one of her first official acts as monarch.

Today the University has five campuses in Southampton, one in Winchester and another in Malaysia. Home to over 21,000 students from more than 130 countries, we are proud of our diverse, vibrant and welcoming community.

Our innovative thinking and pioneering research is making an impact on a global scale; we are finding solutions for some of the biggest challenges which our planet is facing.  This is the place where fibre-optic research is creating a faster, smarter internet; where the immune system is leading the fight against cancer; where expertise is tackling the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance; and where resources are being secured for the world’s growing populations.

We actively help student and staff start-up companies through our business incubators and Science Park. We have developed strong links with industry partners such as Microsoft, IBM and Philips.

The University of Southampton is the perfect place to discover what you’re capable of; from turning an idea into reality and making a real difference, to finding new passions and discovering your next step.
