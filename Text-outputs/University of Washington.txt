Global Innovation ExchangeThe Global Innovation Exchange (GIX) is a global partnership between major research universities and innovative corporations to develop thought leaders in innovation. The first two academic partners are the University of Washington and Tsinghua University, with initial partner support from Microsoft. GIX pioneers new forms of teaching and learning by connecting world-class learners and faculty with research-led companies and non-profits to collaborate on solutions to global challenges.
GIX extends far beyond the walls of the Seattle-area facilities, attracting participants and encouraging collaboration unlimited by geography or discipline. Through project-based learning, students, researchers and industry professionals create solutions to pressing global challenges such as health, sustainability and social innovation.
